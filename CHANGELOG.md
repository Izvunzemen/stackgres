# :rocket: Release 1.4.0-RC2 (2022-11-22)

## :notepad_spiral: NOTES

StackGres 1.4.0-RC2 is out, prepared to help in recovering from a disaster and to hook into the cluster by adding your own custom containers. :confetti_ball: :sos: :alien: :gift_heart:

This release also introduce more support for typical Kubernetes scheduling configuration by adding support for node labels, tolerations, node affinity, pod affinity, pod anty affinity and
 topology spread constraints on all the Pods generated by the operator.

Also, major version upgrade include the most wanted best-effort rollback feature so you will not have to recover a crashed major version upgrade manually if you do not specify any destructive
 option like using clone or link. The check option also changes the operation so that the upgrade will not be performed at all but only checks will run. And, last but not least, the operation
 now also performs a cleanup so that the old data will be wiped out when the operation completes successfully and the primary Pod reach the Ready state.

So, what you are waiting for to try this beta release and have a look to the future of StackGres!

## :up: UPGRADE

To upgrade from a previous installation of the StackGres operator's helm chart you will have to upgrade the helm chart release.
 For more detailed information please refer to [our documentation](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/install/helm/upgrade/#upgrade-operator).

To upgrade StackGres operator's (upgrade only works starting from 1.1 version or above) helm chart issue the following commands (replace namespace and release name if you used something different):

`helm upgrade -n "stackgres" "stackgres-operator" https://stackgres.io/downloads/stackgres-k8s/stackgres/1.4.0-RC2/helm/stackgres-operator.tgz`

> IMPORTANT: This release is incompatible with previous `alpha` or `beta` versions. Upgrading from those versions will require uninstalling completely StackGres including all clusters and StackGres CRDs (those in `stackgres.io` group) first.

Thank you for all the issues created, ideas, and code contributions by the StackGres Community!

# :rocket: Release 1.3.2 (2022-10-14)

## :notepad_spiral: NOTES

StackGres 1.3.2 brings some security improvements and fixes. In particular it comes to fix an issue related to how SGInstanceProfile custom resource works for version 1.3 by applying resource requirements and limits to all the StackGres generated Pods. Due to some default settings that were too conservative for containers some functionalities were broken for some users (in particular for backups and postgres exporter memory was set too low making some Pods getting killed by the OOM killer).
Also a bug in the Web Console that, when editing a StackGres custom resource (and other resources), changed some fields that are not yet implemented there. In particular, the latter bug removed a non production option flag set during operator upgrade that prevented existing cluster from from avoiding following the new behavior of resources requirements for the StackGres Pod's that apply to sidecars increasing the actual requirements of a Pod following the new `.spec.containers` and `.spec.initContainers` section of the SGInstanceProfile resource. If you had upgraded to 1.3.0 or 1.3.1 and your SGCluster's Pods can not restart due to resources not being available consider setting to `true` the field `.spec.nonProductionOptions.disableClusterResourceRequirements` to revert to the same behavior prior version 1.3 where resource requirements only affect the patroni container.

## :sparkles: NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES

* Increased default memory limits and requests requirements for some Pod and sidecars
* Lower the resource requirements for containers other than patroni to only set resource requests and not limits by default (resource limits can still be set for those containers by configuration)

### Web Console

Nothing new here! :eyes: 

## :bug: FIXES

* Default SGScript is not created for SGCluster with version previous to 1.3
* Event of missing SGBackupConfig is sent even if backup is working as expected
* Avoid errors for old versions of a SGBackup, SGDbOps and SGScript
* Field `.spec.pods.managementPolicy` is not implemented in the REST API
* Cluster crash-Loop due to permission change in data dir

### Web Console

*  Babelfish Compass had a cross site script issue that prevent it from functioning
*  When editing a resource unknown fields values are not preserved

## :construction: KNOWN ISSUES

* Installation fails in EKS 1.22+ due to CSR not returning the certificate ([#1732](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1732)). Use cert-manager as a workaround.

# :rocket: Release 1.3.0 (2022-08-23)

## :notepad_spiral: NOTES

StackGres 1.3.0 is out and something is changed!! Thanks to all our growing community for all the feedback they are providing, StackGres is better also thanks to you!! :tada: :cyclone: :top: :heartpulse: 

*IMPORTANT*: PostgreSQL 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3 had an issue with CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY and REINDEX CONCURRENTLY that could cause silent data corruption of indexes. 
 Please upgrade to PostgreSQL 14.5 as soon as possible to avoid any corruption of your data. For more info see https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-144-released-2470/.

*IMPORTANT*: We have introduced a possible breaking change for your deployment since we replaced the `SGBackupConfig` CRD with the `SGObjectStorage` CRD. All your existing clusters will continue to work since the upgrade process
 will take care of converting `SGBackupConfig` CRs to the new `SGObjectStorage` CRs and apply the required changes to the `SGCluster` CRs. The change was needed in order to introduce more functionality in the next releases, but for
 now, the only difference is that `SGObjectStorage` will contain only the `.spec.storage` part of the previous `SGBackupConfig`. Also, the backup configuration in the `SGCluster` is moved to the section `.spec.configurations.backups` where you will be able to set the referenced `SGObjectStorage` and configure the automatic backup properties. Please make sure your deployment code reflects the changes introduced by the upgrade by changing the `.spec.configurations`
 section and converting the `SGBackupConfig` into an `SGObjectStorage`.

Before this release, you had to set SQL scripts at initialization, but now you will be able to change and add them live. Also, scripts will be re-usable since they are now stored in the new SGScript CRD.

When a new cluster is created you will be able to set resource requirements for all the StackGres Pod's containers using the new sections `.spec.containers` and `.spec.initContainers`. Those sections are pre-filled with default values
 and you may disable this behavior by setting to `true` the field `.spec.nonProductionOptions.disableClusterResourceRequirements` in the `SGCluster` and `SGDistributedLogs` CRs.

## :up: UPGRADE

To upgrade from a previous installation of the StackGres operator's helm chart you will have to upgrade the helm chart release.
 For more detailed information please refer to [our documentation](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/install/helm/upgrade/#upgrade-operator).

To upgrade StackGres operator's (upgrade only works starting from 1.1 version or above) helm chart issue the following commands (replace namespace and release name if you used something different):

`helm upgrade -n "stackgres" "stackgres-operator" https://stackgres.io/downloads/stackgres-k8s/stackgres/1.3.0/helm/stackgres-operator.tgz`

> IMPORTANT: This release is incompatible with previous `alpha` or `beta` versions. Upgrading from those versions will require uninstalling completely StackGres including all clusters and StackGres CRDs (those in `stackgres.io` group) first.

Thank you for all the issues created, ideas, and code contributions by the StackGres Community!

# :rocket: Release 1.3.0-RC1 (2022-08-16)

## :notepad_spiral: NOTES

StackGres 1.3.0-RC1 is out and something is changed!! Thanks to all our growing community for all the feedback they are providing, StackGres is better also thank to you!! :tada: :cyclone: :top: :heartpulse: 

*IMPORTANT*: PostgreSQL 14.0, 14.1, 14.2 and 14.3 had an issue with CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY and REINDEX CONCURRENTLY that could cause silent data corruption of indexes. 
 Please upgrade to PostgreSQL 14.4 as soon as possible to avoid any corruption to your data. For more info see https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-144-released-2470/.

*IMPORTANT*: We have introduced a possible breaking change for your deployment since we replaced the `SGBackupConfig` CRD with the `SGObjectStorage` CRD. All your existing clusters will continue to work since the upgrade process
 will take care of converting `SGBackupConfig` CRs to the new `SGObjectStorage` CRs and apply the required changes into the `SGCluster` CRs. The change was needed in order to introduce more functionality in next releases, but for
 now the only difference is that `SGObjectStorage` will contain only the `.spec.storage` part of the previous `SGBackupConfig`. Also the backup configuration in the `SGCluster` is moved to the section `.spec.configurations.backups`
 where you will be able to set the referenced `SGObjectStorage` and configure the automatic backup properties. Please, make sure your deployment code reflect the changes introduced by the upgrade by changing the `.spec.configurations`
 section and converting the `SGBackupConfig` into an `SGObjectStorage`.

Before this release you had to set SQL scripts at initialization, but now you will be able to change and add them live. Also scripts will be re-usable since they are now stored in the new SGScript CRD.

When a new cluster is created you will be able to set resource requirements for all the StackGres Pod's containers using the new sections `.spec.containers` and `.spec.initContainers`. Those sections are pre-filled with default values
 and you may disable this behavior by setting to `true` the field `.spec.nonProductionOptions.disableClusterResourceRequirements` in the `SGCluster` and `SGDistributedLogs` CRs.

* Major version upgrade fails if some extensions version are not available for the target Postgres version ([#1368](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1368)) 
* After major version upgrade continuous archiving and backups may hang ([#1383](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1383)) 
* Backups may be restored with inconsistencies when performed with a Postgres instance running on a different architecture ([#1539](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1539))

## :up: UPGRADE

To upgrade from a previous installation of the StackGres operator's helm chart you will have to upgrade the helm chart release.
 For more detailed information please refer to [our documentation](https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/install/helm/upgrade/#upgrade-operator).

To upgrade StackGres operator's (upgrade only works starting from 1.0 version or above) helm chart issue following commands (replace namespace and release name if you used something different):

`helm upgrade -n "stackgres" "stackgres-operator" https://stackgres.io/downloads/stackgres-k8s/stackgres/latest/helm/stackgres-operator.tgz`

> IMPORTANT: This release is incompatible with previous `alpha` or `beta` versions. Upgrading from those versions will require uninstalling completely StackGres including all clusters and StackGres CRDs (those in `stackgres.io` group) first.

# :rocket: Release 1.1.0 (2022-02-01)

## :notepad_spiral: NOTES

Here comes StackGres 1.1.0 the awaited gift of this Christmas with a new tasty and fishy flavor ARMed to the teeth!! :christmas_tree: :fishing_pole_and_fish: :bomb: :tada: :bottle_with_popping_cork:

We have listened to you. Did you want ARM? Here it comes! Finally, you can run Postgres on Kubernetes on ARM64 nodes. This release brings support ARM64 architecture in order to run StackGres even on a Raspberry Pi (and of course on cool ARM hardware, like AWS Graviton 2/3). And the new experimental Postgres for Babelfish flavor allows you to connect to Postgres using the SQLServer protocol! (which is also available on ARM).

## :sparkles: NEW FEATURES AND CHANGES

* Add support for ARM64 architecture
* New Postgres versions 14.1, 13.5 and 12.9
* Support for [Postgres for Babelfish](https://babelfishpg.org/) version 13.4, both for AMD64 and ARM64
* Completely redesigned cluster creation form: it is now implemented wizard-style, with separate steps for each major relevant function
* Patroni 2.1.2
* PgBouncer 1.16.1
* Prometheus Postgres Exporter 0.10.1
* Check for Postgres timeline when failing or switching over a replica to avoid data loss as much as possible.
* Support to specify external IPs for Postgres services
* Support to configure resources in operator helm chart
* Support Kubernetes 1.23
* Suggest default names for manual backups and dbops in the Web UI

## :bug: FIXES

* Configuration does not include shared_preloaded_libraries when performing pg_upgrade
* Support allowing restart when primary pod is unavailable
* When deleting primary Pod cluster may become unresponsive
* Restart not restarting the cluster
* Internal DNS for services not using configured search names
* If backup used in initialData is removed the reconciliation cycle crashes
* Infinite running state when restarting Pod after invalid configuration
* Some resources are continuously patched
* Major version upgrade cannot be performed now if not all installed extensions are not available in the new postgres major version
* Init reconciliation cycle should fail for any error
* Support migration from Client Side Apply to Server Side Apply
* Error in endpoints stats from REST API

## :construction: KNOWN ISSUES

* Installation fails in EKS 1.21+ due to CSR not returning the certificate ([#1358](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1358)) 
* Major version upgrade fails if some extensions version are not available for the target Postgres version ([#1368](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1368))

* Backups may be restored with inconsistencies when performed with a Postgres instance running on a different architecture ([#1539](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1539))
* After upgrading StackGres operator newer Postgres versions that can not be used for a not upgraded SGCluster may be erroneously presented in the Web UI ([#1540](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/1540))

## :up: UPGRADE

To upgrade from a previous installation of the StackGres operator's helm chart you will have to upgrade the helm chart release.

All extensions can be created with a regular `CREATE EXTENSION` command. To create then, connect on the database through `psql` then run:

```sql
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION
```
> Check [here for more details]({{% relref "05-administration-guide/02-Connecting-to-the-cluster/03-postgres-util" %}}) about how to connect using kubectl.

## Checking available extensions

Besides the [standard PostgreSQL extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html), StackGres ships with the following extensions:

* [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis)
* [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)
* [pgbouncer_fdw](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgbouncer_fdw)
* [pgsphere](https://github.com/akorotkov/pgsphere)
* [pg_repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack)
* [pg_healpix](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/pg_healpix)
* [pg_q3c](https://github.com/segasai/q3c)

Check the current [version on the releases]({{% relref "/01-introduction/06-versions#additional-extensions-included-on-stackgres" %}}) page.

### Checking installed extensions

Execute the metacommand `\dxi` to list the installed extensions:

```bash
postgres=# \dxi
                                     List of installed extensions
        Name        | Version |   Schema   |                        Description                        
--------------------+---------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
 pg_stat_statements | 1.7     | public     | track execution statistics of all SQL statements executed
 plpgsql     
```

### Custom `shared_preload_libraries` for extensions

Both `timescaledb` and `pg_stat_statements` need a custom configuration. To fix that is necessary to add a new configuration that contains the custom value on `shared_preload_libraries`, like the example below:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | kubectl create -f -

apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGPostgresConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-conf
spec:
  postgresVersion: "12"
  postgresql.conf:
    shared_preload_libraries: 'pg_stat_statements, timescaledb'

---
apiVersion: stackgres.io/v1
kind: SGCluster
metadata:
  name: extensions
spec:
  instances: 2
  postgresVersion: 'latest'
  pods:
    persistentVolume: 
      size: '1Gi'
  configurations:
    sgPostgresConfig: custom-conf
EOF
```

Once the config is done and the cluster is ready, you can create the extension without errors:

```sql
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb CASCADE;

If you happen to be reading this, it's because you are aware of your application characteristics and needs for scaling connections on a production environment.

A simple way to target this correctly, is to verify the usage of Prepared Statements, on top of which `session` mode will be the only compatible.

Some applications, do not handle connection closing properly, which may require to add certain timeouts for releasing server connections.


## Reloading configuration

In the [Customizing Pooling configuration section]({{% relref "06-crd-reference/04-connection-pooling-configuration/#pgbouncer" %}}),
 it is explained the different sauces for scaling connections properly.

Each configuration, once applied, need to be _reloaded_. This can be done by getting the
 corresponding primary node pod name and issue the same signal it is done on most of the
 environments:

```
PRIMARY=$(kubectl get pod -l role=master -n my-cluster -o name)
kubectl exec -n my-cluster -it ${PRIMARY} -c postgres-util -- pkill --signal HUP pgbouncer
```

This runbook will show you how to add Postgres alerts to your Prometheus installation and give you some usefull ones.

## Environment

This runbook will show you to add postgres alerts using a default Prometheus installation with [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack). In case you still haven't a Prometheus installation follow the steps in the [StackGres tutorial]({{% relref "03-tutorial/01-pre-requisites/03-prometheus-grafana" %}}).

The Prometheus installation will add to your K8s cluster some CRS's:

```
$ kubectl get crd -o name | grep monitoring
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/probes.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com
```

## Defining your alerts

The Prometheus resources allow you to add Prometheus instances and Prometheus rules. The prometheus rules are the resources to define your alerts using `promql` with some other required parameters. This is and example of a postgres rule:

```
- alert: PostgresInstanceDown
      expr: pg_up == 0
      for: 1m
      labels:
        severity: critical
        service: "PostgreSQL"
      annotations:
        summary: "Postgres server instance is down"
        description: "Postgres has not been responding for the past 1 minutes on {{ $labels.instance }}"
        title: "Postgres server instance {{ $labels.instance }} is down "
```

The `expr` parameter is the prometheus query to retreive the data for the alert in this example `pg_up` metric return `0` is the instance is down and `1` if up. The `for` parameter is the threshold time to evaluate the query. Then you can also add labels and annotations to describe more precisely your alert. So the above example means `If the pg_up metric value is equal to zero for 1m then fire the alert`. Check the alerts section below for the full alerts description and the `yaml` file definition.

## Alerts

These are some useful alerts you can add to your StackGres cluster.

| Alert                                    | Severity | Threshod | Description                                                     |

| PgBouncerAvgWaitTimeTooHigh              | warning  |   5m     | Check if time spent by clients waiting for a connections > 1s   |
| PgBouncerQueryTimeTooHigh                | warning  |   5m     | Check if average query duration more than 5 seconds             |

        description: "Database disk is filling up currently have less than 20%, currently occupied {{ $value }} %"

```

and deploy it to kubernetes:

```
kubectl apply -f stackgres-alerts.yaml
```


## How Prometheus discover the alerts

With the default prometheus installation some deployment will be added:

```
$ kubectl get deployments.apps -n monitoring
NAME                                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
prometheus-operator-grafana              1/1     1            1           25d
prometheus-operator-kube-p-operator      1/1     1            1           25d
prometheus-operator-kube-state-metrics   1/1     1            1           25d
```

This will create a Prometheus instance:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n monitoring -l app=prometheus
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-prometheus-operator-kube-p-prometheus-0   2/2     Running   0          25d
```

This instance has defined a `ruleSelector` section with some labels:

```
$ kubectl get -n monitoring prometheus prometheus-operator-kube-p-prometheus -o yaml | grep -A3 ruleSelector
  ruleSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kube-prometheus-stack
      release: prometheus-operator
```


You need to make sure the `metadata` labels from your `Prometheus Rule` match with the `ruleSelector` labels of your prometheus instance. In this case will be as is shown below:

```
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    app: kube-prometheus-stack
    release: prometheus-operator
  name: stackgres-rules
  namespace: monitoring
  ...
  ...
  ```

Prometheus will autodiscover the alerts according to the matching lables and add them to the instance:

![Alerts](prometheus_alerts.png "Postgres Alerts")



## Email alerts with AlertManager

Once you have configured the alerts on Prometheus, depending on your infrastructure you can create push messages in an alert is fire. You could use, email, [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Pagerduty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), [Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) and others. Check [Alert Manager Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/) for more details. In this example you'll see how to configure alerts with email messages.

The Prometheus stack installation include an installation of AlertManager:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n monitoring -l app=alertmanager
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
alertmanager-prometheus-operator-kube-p-alertmanager-0   2/2     Running   0          68m
```

The alerting configuration is added using a secret::

```
$ kubectl get secrets -n monitoring alertmanager-prometheus-operator-kube-p-alertmanager
NAME                                                   TYPE     DATA   AGE
alertmanager-prometheus-operator-kube-p-alertmanager   Opaque   1      30d
```

To update the configuration you need to first create a `yml` file `alertmanager.yaml` with the next content(Replace the users and credentials with your settings):

```
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  receiver: 'email-alert'
  group_by: ['datname']

  routes:
  - receiver: 'email-alert'
    group_wait: 50s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h

receivers:
- name: email-alert
  email_configs:
  - to: email-group@ongres.com
    from: stackgres-alerts@ongres.com
    # Your smtp server address
    smarthost: mail.ongres.com:587
    auth_username: myuser@ongres.com
    auth_identity: myuser@ongres.com
    auth_password: XXXXXXX
```

Next you need to encrypt the content of the file running:

```
$ cat alertmanager.yaml | base64 -w0
```

This will return a string like:

```
Z2xvYmFsOgogIHJlc29sdmVfdGltZW91dDogNW0Kcm91dGU6CiAgcmVjZWl2ZXI6ICdlbWFpbC1hbGVydCcK
```

Edit the alertmanager secret with the string generated with the command above:

```
$ kubectl patch secret -n monitoring alertmanager-prometheus-operator-kube-p-alertmanager -p='{"data":{"alertmanager.yaml": "Z2xvYmFsOgogIHJlc29sdmVfdGltZW91dDogNW0Kcm91dGU6CiAgcmVjZWl2ZXI6ICdlbWFpbC1hbGVydCcK"}}' -v=1
```

After a few seconds, the new configuration will be applied, you can verify it by accessing the AlertManager console, with:

```
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring alertmanager-prometheus-operator-kube-p-alertmanager-0 9093:9093
```

Then open your web browser and type:

```
http://localhost:9093
```


![Alert Manager](alert_manager_home.png "Alert Manager")


Now go to the `Status` section and verify your changes were applied:

![Alert Manager Conf](alertmanager_conf.png "Alert Manager Conf")


If there's an active alert on your cluster you should see it in the alert manager console:

![Alert Manager Alert](alertmanager_alert.png "Alert Manager Alert")

And if the email configuration and credentials you provide are OK, you'll get the alert message:

![Alert Manager Message](alert_manager_message.png "Alert Manager Message")

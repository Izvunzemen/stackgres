As explained in the [Demo section]({{% relref "02-demo-quickstart/01-setting-up-the-environment/_index.md" %}}), for setting up the Operator and StackGres Cluster, you need to have an
environment on top of which it needs to request the necessary resources.

StackGres 1.x is able to run on any Kubernetes installation from 1.16 to 1.19 version, if you need support for older Kubernetes please use the 0.9.x branch that it's on maintainance mode.
